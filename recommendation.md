## Data Format Recommendation: TSV vs. JSON

For the extracted data, which consists of 'Scheme Name' and 'Asset Value', both TSV (Tab Separated Values) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are viable formats. However, considering the nature of this specific dataset, here's a recommendation:

### TSV (Tab Separated Values)

**Pros:**
*   **Simplicity and Readability:** TSV is a very straightforward format. Each line represents a record, and values are separated by tabs. This makes it highly human-readable and easy to inspect directly in a text editor or spreadsheet program.
*   **Ease of Parsing:** Many tools and programming languages have built-in support or simple methods for parsing TSV files, making it easy to import into databases, spreadsheets, or for basic scripting.
*   **Efficiency for Tabular Data:** For data that is inherently tabular, like a list of scheme names and their corresponding asset values, TSV is a very efficient and compact representation.

**Cons:**
*   **Lack of Structure:** TSV does not inherently support complex data structures or nested objects. While not an issue for this simple dataset, it would become problematic if more hierarchical information were needed.
*   **No Data Types:** All values in a TSV file are treated as strings. If you need to perform numerical operations on the 'Asset Value', you would need to explicitly convert it to a number in your processing script.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

**Pros:**
*   **Structured Data:** JSON is excellent for representing structured and hierarchical data. Each record could be an object with clearly defined keys ('Scheme Name', 'Asset Value').
*   **Data Types:** JSON supports various data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects), meaning 'Asset Value' could be stored directly as a number.
*   **Widespread Use:** JSON is the de facto standard for data exchange in web applications and APIs, making it highly interoperable with modern systems.

**Cons:**
*   **Verbosity for Simple Data:** For a simple two-column dataset, JSON can be more verbose than TSV due to the overhead of keys and structural characters (curly braces, square brackets, commas).
*   **Less Human-Readable:** While structured, JSON can be less immediately readable for a human eye compared to the clean column-and-row format of TSV, especially for large files.
*   **Requires Parsing:** To effectively use JSON data, you almost always need a JSON parser, whereas TSV can often be handled with basic string splitting.

### Recommendation

Given that the data consists of simple pairs of 'Scheme Name' and 'Asset Value', **TSV is the recommended format for this specific task.**

Here's why:

1.  **Simplicity and Directness:** The data is flat and tabular. TSV perfectly matches this structure without adding unnecessary complexity or verbosity.
2.  **Ease of Use:** For a shell script, extracting and formatting data into TSV is very straightforward using `awk` or `cut`, as demonstrated. This keeps the script simple and efficient.
3.  **Human Readability:** If you or others need to quickly glance at the data, the TSV format is much easier to comprehend at a glance than a JSON array of objects.

While JSON offers more advanced structuring capabilities, those benefits are not significantly leveraged by this particular dataset. If, however, the data were to become more complex in the future (e.g., nested details for each scheme, multiple dates, etc.), then migrating to JSON would be a logical and beneficial step. For now, TSV provides the most efficient and user-friendly solution.
